# AsyncAPI Holopin Badges

Welcome to the official AsyncAPI Holopin Badges!

This folder contains all the official badge designs used by the AsyncAPI Initiative to recognize, appreciate, and celebrate the many individuals and groups who contribute to our ecosystem. From contributors, maintainers, and sponsors, to mentors, mentees, ambassadors, and event volunteers—these badges are a token of recognition for the incredible efforts that drive the AsyncAPI community forward.
These badges are created for use on [Holopin](https://www.holopin.io), a platform where contributors can showcase digital collectibles for their open-source efforts.
